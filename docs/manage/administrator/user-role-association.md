* Here, roles can be assigned folder-wise.
* Permissions' Inheritance in Child Hierarchy:
  * Roles associated with given folder would be inherited in entire child hierarchy of that folder. 
  * Associating roles in the child folder will override roles of parent folder. 
* Assigning any role in a given folder indicates that user will have **Read** access to all integration resources in that folder and its child hierarchy as well.
* Assigning any role with **Read** access to integration or mapping in a child folder indicates **Read** access to all associated mappings and systems in the parent folder.
