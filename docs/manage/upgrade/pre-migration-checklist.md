# Migrating <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> version to 7.121 or above

## Upgradation of MySQL Server
**Applicable When:** <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> is installed with MySQL database.

**Reason:** From version 7.121 onward, the special characters having 4 byte UTF8 encoding can be stored in <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> database.

**Actions:** Upgrade MySQL database to 5.7.18 or above versions.

---

# Migrating <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> version to 7.134 or above

**Applicable When:** If <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> is installed with MSSQL database and the base installation version of <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> is 6.03 or an earlier version.

**Actions:**
- Execute the following queries to remove the default value constraint for column `Is_marked_deleted` of table `OHMT_EAI_entity_info` in MSSQL:
  ```
  SELECT col.name AS ColumnName, def.name AS ConstraintName 
  FROM sys.default_constraints def 
  INNER JOIN sys.columns col 
  ON def.parent_object_id = col.object_id 
     AND def.parent_column_id = col.column_id 
  WHERE parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'DATABASE_NAME.TABLE_NAME');
  ```
  - The above query's output will be the constraint's name to be dropped. Example: `'DF__OHMT_EAI___Is_ma__63E3BB6D'`. Please put the constraint name fetched above in the query below to drop the constraint.
  ```
  ALTER TABLE DATABASE_NAME.TABLE_NAME DROP CONSTRAINT CONSTRAINT_NAME_FOUND_FROM_ABOVE_QUERY_FOR_COLUMN_IS_MARKED_DELETED;
  ```

**Reason:** In the 6.03 version, the default value was added to the `Is_marked_deleted` column of `OHMT_EAI_entity_info`. Because of this, MSSQL implicitly added a default constraint on this table. In the 7.134 version, the column `Is_marked_deleted` was dropped as a part of one feature of <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>.

# Migrating <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> version to 7.139 or above

**Applicable When:** If the initial installation version of <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> is 6.11 Update 2 HF4 or earlier, the actions mentioned must be performed.

**Reason:** In the `reportsdb` database's `ReportsDBVersion` table, `6.11.02.00.00` entry was wrongly added to the `version` column.

**Actions:**
```sql
DELETE FROM reportsdb.ReportsDBVersion WHERE version='6.11.02.00.00';
```

## Updating the MSSQL 2012 database connector JAR

**Applicable When:**
- This update is necessary if <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> is running on MSSQL 2012 and currently using the connector JAR package `sqljdbc_6.0.8112.100_enu.tar.gz`.

**Actions:**
**Prerequisites**
1. If the current OIM version is lower than <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> 7.143 and an upgrade to 7.172 is required, follow these steps:
   - First, upgrade to <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> 7.143 using the old JAR file, `sqljdbc_6.0.8112.100_enu.tar.gz`.
   - After completing the migration to version 7.143, proceed with the steps mentioned below and then upgrade to version 7.172.

- Locate the old JAR file `sqljdbc42.jar` in the following directories:
  - `<INSTALLATION_PATH>/Connector_Jars/`
  - `<INSTALLATION_PATH>/OpsHubServer/lib/`

- Replace the old JAR file with the new JAR `mssql-jdbc-10.2.0.jre11.jar`:
  - Download the new JAR from [this link](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2186164)
  - Unzip the new connector JAR package `sqljdbc_10.2.0.0_enu.tar.gz`
  - Locate `mssql-jdbc-10.2.0.jre11.jar` in the directory `sqljdbc_10.2.0.0_enu/sqljdbc_10.2/enu`
  - Copy the new JAR to the directories mentioned above and delete the old JAR `sqljdbc42.jar` from both the locations.

- If Windows authentication is being used, follow these additional steps:
  - Copy `mssql-jdbc_auth-10.2.0.x64.dll` from `sqljdbc_10.2.0.0_enu/sqljdbc_10.2/enu/auth/x64` to `<INSTALLATION_PATH>/OpsHub_Resources/jre/bin`.
  - Delete the existing `sqljdbc_auth.dll` located in `<INSTALLATION_PATH>/OpsHub_Resources/jre/bin`.

**Reason:**
- Flyway has been updated from version 4.2 to 10.15, and the newer version does not support the connector JAR `sqljdbc42.jar`. Therefore, it is necessary to upgrade to `mssql-jdbc-10.2.0.jre11.jar` to maintain compatibility and avoid <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> upgrade failure.
