During the installation of OpsHub Integration Manager, few temporary files are placed/copied in the TEMP directory [i.e., the path which is specified in TEMP environment variable]. This directory path should not contain ";" as well as none of the directory/folder names should end with "!" in this path.  
* Example: "C:\Users\xyz!\AppData\Local\Temp" or "C:\Users\xy;z\AppData\Local\Temp" as Temp environment variable value/path is not allowed.  
* In such case, the installation will fail with error. Please refer [here](../Erros/ops-005.md) for more details on this error and steps for its resolution. To check how to set TEMP environment variable, please refer below.
