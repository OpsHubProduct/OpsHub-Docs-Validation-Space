- For seamless running of <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>, the permissions mentioned for installation and upgrade only can be revoked.

- The default installation of <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> with Oracle:
  - Two users are created by <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>: `opshub` and `reportsdb`. 
  - The user through which the database is connected will perform the following:
    - Create these users. Hence, `CREATE USER` permission is required at the installation time.
    - Grant certain permissions to these users (`opshub` and `reportsdb`) to connect with their database and create the required data in their database. Hence, `WITH ADMIN OPTION` is required.
    - Perform certain operations on the resources of these two users. Hence, it requires `ANY*` permissions.

- In the advanced installation, if <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> is going to be installed with the option of the [manual creation of the database](../../getting-started/installation.md#manual-creation-of-the-databases), then:
  - One of the users (`opshub` or `reportsdb`) can be used to connect with the Oracle database and perform all the operations.
  - In this case, `CREATE USER` privilege can be omitted, and only `SELECT ANY TABLE` privilege would require `WITH ADMIN OPTION` during installation.

- It is recommended to create a database manually for a high-security environment. The credentials are used as input to create two new users during the installation, so `CREATE USER` permission is required.  
  If any permission regarding creating a user is missing, then <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> will print the password through SQL query.  
  'Create schema' approach was considered, but as Oracle doesn't allow creating schemas alone, we have to go with the 'Create User' approach.

- If installation is to be done in the **cdb$root container of CDB instance**, then the connection user should have the commonly granted `CREATE USER` permission.  
  To achieve this, the `container=ALL` clause needs to be used while granting the permission.  
  The sample query for creating the user:
  
   `CREATE USER c##username IDENTIFIED BY password container=ALL;`

- After the user is created, the permission should be verified with the following query:  
  `SELECT * FROM USER_SYS_PRIVS;`

- Find the below screenshot which shows correct permission for CREATE USER privilege:
