# Advance Mapping Utility

## Overview
* This Advance Utility is useful when user want some customization in default xslt or user have some specific requirement. For acheiving those requirement <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> provides some Utilities which handle some custom requirement.

## Common placeholder and its value

<p align="center">

| **Placeholder**   | **Value**                        | **Description** |
|:-----------------:|:--------------------------------:|-----------------|
| `<<Workflow Id>>`   | $workflowId                      | if workflowId is required for any utility pass it as $workflowId, it is always available in mapping xml. |
| `<<System Id>>`     | $sourceSystemId or $targetSystemId | If the requirement is to have the value for the source system then set this as '$sourceSystemId' and if the requirement is to have the value for the target system then set the value as '$targetSystemId'. |

## Utilities

### Get Field Value of Entity
* **Overview:** This Utility will help to fetch value of any field of specific entity.  
* **Utility Definition:**  
  ```code
  getEntityFieldValue(WorkflowId, SystemId, ProjectValue, EntityType, EntityId, FieldInternalName)
  ```
* This utility can be used in the advance xslt in this manner:  

  ```xml
  <xsl:value-of select="utils:getEntityFieldValue(<<Workflow Id>>,<<System Id>>,<<Project Value>>,<<Entity Internal Name>>,<<Entity Id>>,<<Internal Field Name>>)"/>
  ```
*How to set the placeholders:*  
- `<Workflow Id>`: refer [Common placeholder and its value](#common-placeholder-and-its-value) section.  
- `<System Id>`: refer [Common placeholder and its value](#common-placeholder-and-its-value) section.  
- `<Project Value>`: Pass project's value if required else pass null.  
- `<Entity Internal Name>`: Pass internal name for the entity.  
- `<Entity Id>`: Pass internal id of specific entity for fetching particular field's value.  
- `<Internal Field Name>`: Pass field's internal name for fetching value of it.

### Get Matching Lookup Value of Target from Source

- **Overview:** This Utility will help to find matching lookup value from system by giving regular expression.  
- **Utility Definition:**  
  ```text
  getMatchingLookupValue(WorkflowId, SystemId, projectValue, EntityType, RegexExpression, isRegexOnInternalValue, isThrowErrorOnMultipleMatch, isRefreshOnCacheMiss)
  ```
* This utility can be used in advance xslt in this manner:  

```xml
<xsl:value-of select="utils:getMatchingLookupValue(<<Workflow Id>>,$targetSystemId,<<Project Value>>,<<Internal Field Name>>,<<RegexExpression>>,<<Regex on Internal Value>>,<<Throw Error On Multiple Match>>,<<Refresh On Cache Missing>>)"/>
```
*How to set the placeholders:*  
- `<<Workflow Id>>`: refer [Common placeholder and its value](#common-placeholder-and-its-value) section.  
- `<<Project Value>>`: Pass project's value if required else pass null.  
- `<<Internal Field Name>>`: Pass field's internal name for fetching value of it.  
- `<<RegexExpression>>`: Here, the user can pass a valid regular expression. If user wants to map the lookup values in such a way that it fetches the value which ends with field value of source entity, then pass `concat('.*','<<Searched value>>')`.  
- `<<Regex On Internal Value>>`: Pass this as `'true'`, if user wants to search value on basis of internal value of lookup, else pass `'false'` which will search on the basis of display value of lookup.  
- `<<Throw Error On Multiple Match>>`: Pass this as `'true'`, if user wants to throw error if multiple match are found for given expression, else pass `'false'` which will throw error in case there are multiple lookups with the same value found.  
- `<<Refresh On Cache Miss>>`: <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> maintains cache for lookups to decrease the number of times API is called for the end system. If the user passes the value as `'true'`, <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> will reload the cache if a lookup with a certain value is not found. If this is passed as `'false'`, <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> will always refer the cache and will not reload the cache if a certain matching lookup is not found.
