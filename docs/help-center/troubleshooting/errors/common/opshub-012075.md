## Description

For OpsHub-012075, the following error message appears:

OpsHub-012075: Processing blocked - for the enitity `<entity-id>` because the other integration is trying to synchronize the data from this entity. You may need to retry this error once the processing of this entity is completed.


## Cause

* In the bidirectional integration between systems A and B, before {{SITENAME}} processed the sync, the entity was updated in system B first when the entity was trying to sync to system A. In such a case, it leads to data inconsistency in the sync.  
* To prevent this data inconsistency, {{SITENAME}} blocks the processing of the entity.

## Solution

1. You may need to retry this failure once the processing of this entity is completed. For this, the sync logs can be analyzed to make sure that processing is completed for this entity.  
2. Navigate to the integration for which this failure occurred. Retry the failure by clicking 'Retry All With Dependents' failure option. For more information on how to retry failure, refer to [Action on failures](../../../troubleshooting/manage-integration-failures.md#action-on-failures) section.
