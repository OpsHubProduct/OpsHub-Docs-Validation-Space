## Description

When you encounter OpsHub-020401, then the following message appears:

`OpsHub-020401 : Processing blocked for the entity with the id <Entity Id> because some other integration is processing the event sync for this entity.`

## Cause
* When a single entity is synchronized via multiple integrations at the same time due to "Entity type" and/or "Project" change or single "Entity type" and/or "Project" to multiple "Entity types" and/or "Projects" configuration, the integration which has fetched the changes on the entity from the source system at first will process the synchronization. Other integration will have a failure with this error code, which will block the processing of the entity temporarily.
* <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> temporarily blocks this processing for data consistency.
* For example, if integration 1 from system A\[Bug] to system B\[Defect] had started synchronization and performed a partial update in system B. Meanwhile, the entity type is updated from "Bug" to "Story" in system A. Hence, the other integration from system A\[Story] to system B\[Requirement] will synchronize the same entity simultaneously. If <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> allows this synchronization, the end result might be inconsistent.

## Solution
1. This failure will be resolved automatically with the default integration [advanced configuration](../../../../integrate/integration-configuration.md#advance-settings).
2. The following actions will be required if the advanced integration configuration is not set to default values:  
   - If "New Event" has been selected in the ["Sync" advance configuration](../../../../integrate/integration-configuration.md#sync-new-failed-or-both-events) of the integration in which this failure has occurred, then this configuration needs to be updated to "Both (Failed and New Events)".  
   - If 0 value is set for the ["Maximum Retry Count"](../../../../integrate/integration-configuration.md#maximum-retry-count) in the advanced integration configuration, this failure must be manually retried to resolve it.
