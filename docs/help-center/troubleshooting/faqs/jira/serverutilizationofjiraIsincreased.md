## Description
Jira On-Premise Server is overloaded with REST API request from sync user. How to reduce the issue of this overloading on Jira On-Premise server?

## Solution
For **Cookie-Based Authentication**, it does less number of internal API calls. For knowing the difference between **Basic Authentication** and **Cookie-Based Authentication** and to know how to enable **Cookie-Based Authentication**, refer: [Which authentication modes for Jira On-Premise instance are supported by OpsHub Integration Manager for synchronization?](types-of-authentication-jira.md)

If **Cookie-Based Authentication** is enabled and if Jira Server is still getting overloaded with REST API request from sync user, then contact our support portal for further guidance.
