## Description

{{SITENAME}} provides installation options with these 5 types of databases: HSQL, MYSQL, MS SQL, ORACLE, PostgreSQL. Among these, which one is our recommended database for {{SITENAME}} installation?

## Solution

If {{SITENAME}} is being installed for POC (Proof of Concept) purpose or no other database server is available, then HSQL can be used as this is the in-built database provided by {{SITENAME}}. But if {{SITENAME}} is going to be used for production purpose, then HSQL is not recommended as it is not scalable. One of the below database options can be used for installation:

1. MySQL  
2. MS SQL / Azure SQL  
3. Oracle  
4. PostgreSQL
