## Description

This describes required pre-requisites for ServiceNow integration.

## Solution

For ServiceNow integration, configuration of import set table and transform map are required.

If you are integrating ServiceNow as only source, you can create import set table and transform map with a single field.

But in case of a bi-directional integration, or when ServiceNow is the target system for all the fields that you want to synchronize, import set and transform map configuration will be required.

For steps, please refer [Import Set and Transformation map](../../../../connectors/servicenow.md#configure-import-set-table-and-transformation-map).
