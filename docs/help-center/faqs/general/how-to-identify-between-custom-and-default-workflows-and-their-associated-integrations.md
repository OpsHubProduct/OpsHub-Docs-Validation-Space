## Solution: Identifying Workflow Categories

In <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>, you can view workflow categories in the UI to easily identify default workflows from custom ones.

### Steps to View Workflow Categories

1. Navigate to the **View Integrations** Page.  

2. Click on the **Configure Workflow Screen** option from the left bar.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="../../../assets/AllIntegrations.png" alt="All Integrations" />
</p>

3. On the Workflow page, you can see a list of all workflows, along with associated integration details, workflow type, category, and description.  
   Here, the **Category** column shows if a workflow is **Default (pre-installed)** or **Custom (user-created)**. This allows you to quickly identify the category of each workflow.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="../../../assets/WorkflowCategory.png" alt="Workflow Category" />
</p>

4. To view the integrations associated with a particular workflow, refer to the **No. of Integrations** column.  
   For **Customized Workflow**, click on the number under **No. of Integrations** to view the integrations linked to the customized workflow.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="../../../assets/ClickOnCustomized.png" alt="Click On Customized" />
</p>
* This will show the integrations associated with **Customized Workflow**.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="../../../assets/CustomizedWorkflowIntegration.png" alt="Customized Workflow Integration" />
</p>

* Similarly, for **Default Workflow**, click on the number under **No. of Integrations** to view the integrations linked to the default workflow.

This streamlined process allows for easy identification and tracking of workflow categories and their associated integrations.
