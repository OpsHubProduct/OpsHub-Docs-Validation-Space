* **On OpsHub Cloud**: Can be deployed on Azure environment provided by OpsHub. This will come at an additional cost, which can be discussed with your point of contact in the support or sales team.
* **On Customer Cloud**: Can be deployed on cloud service hosted by customer. Supported cloud service on which it can be deployed are:
  * Amazon EC2
  * Azure

Following are the Operating System (OS) and hardware pre-requisites for server or VM where <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> is installed.

# Supported Operating Systems

## Windows

* Windows Server 2008 R2 and above (64 bit)
* For Windows specific configuration, refer [Windows specific configuration](prerequisites.md#windows-specific-configuration)

## Linux

* RHEL 5.2 and above (64 bit)
  * RHEL includes Cent OS and Fedora
* Ubuntu 22.04 and above

# Hardware Prerequisites

1. RAM - 8 GB & above
2. Disk space - 50 GB (Recommended)
3. Database Disk Space - 15 GB (Recommended)
4. Cores - Quadcore (Recommended)

# Database Prerequisites

<code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> can be deployed with an embedded database; however, for production deployment or anything other than functional testing, our experts highly recommend using an external database. <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> supports the following database.

## 1. MySQL Server

{% include "../.gitbook/includes/mysql-preq.md" %}

## 2. MS SQL/Azure SQL Server

{% include "../.gitbook/includes/mssql-preq.md" %}

## 3. Oracle

{% include "../.gitbook/includes/oracle-preq.md" %}

## 4. PostgreSQL Server

{% include "../.gitbook/includes/posgres-preq.md" %}

> **Note**: If default connection timeout parameter is changed for any database server, then it must be confirmed that sufficient connection timeout has been set. For example, for MySQL the default server-side connection timeout is 8 hours. If it is changed and set to, say, 5 minutes, then the default server-side connection timeout must be updated accordingly. **<code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>** maintains connection pools that keep connections alive for 8 hours. Based on the need, this parameter can be tuned at both the application and database-server levels.**Generally, the recommended timeout is between 6-8 hours.**
