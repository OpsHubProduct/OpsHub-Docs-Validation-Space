# SSL Certificate Import Instructions

**OpsHub Integration Manager** will automatically import the certificate if you create or edit a system.  
If the certificate does not import automatically during project or entity selection, you may see error messages like:

- `Peer is not authenticated`
- `Peer's identity has not been verified`
- `Handshake failure` or `Handshake exception`

If the certificate is not imported, follow the steps below.

## Import SSL Certificate through Console

Follow the steps below to import the downloaded certificate into **OpsHub Integration Manager**:

1. Open **Command Prompt** with Administrator privileges (right-click `cmd.exe` → **Run as Administrator**).  
2. Navigate to the folder:  
   `<<OpsHub_Installation_Directory>>\AppData\OpsHubData`

3. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   keytool –importcert -alias <<certificate alias>> -keystore <<path>> -file "Certificate_Location\Certificate filename.extension"
   ```

   **Example**:

   ```sh
   keytool -importcert -alias httpscertifcate -keystore "C:\Program Files\OpsHub\AppData\OpsHubData\cacerts" -file "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\certificate.crt"
   ```

4. When prompted, enter the keystore password.  
   **Note**: The default keystore password is `changeit`.

5. Type `yes` when asked: **Trust this certificate?**  
6. Restart the OpsHub Server.

**Important Notes**:

- If any hierarchy is present in the certificate, all certificates must be imported.
- If multiple end system certificates are configured in **OpsHub Integration Manager** and these certificates have different private key passwords, use the **Certificate Password Encryptor Utility** to encrypt and store the passwords.
  - This utility creates a `cacert_config.properties` file containing all alias names and their encrypted passwords.
  - You can use this file to load the certificates from the keystore in **OpsHub Integration Manager**.
