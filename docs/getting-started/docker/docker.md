  ```bash
  docker load --input <Image_tar_filename>
  ```
- After updating Input.json and docker-compose-OIM.yml, run following command to start (up) the container:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose-OIM.yml up
  ```
- `-d` can also be added as an option to start docker container in detached mode.
