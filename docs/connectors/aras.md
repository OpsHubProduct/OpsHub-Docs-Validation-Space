## Versionable Item Type 

* For any Item Type in Aras Innovator, the versions/history for the item gets generated only when the item is versionable. Hence for <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> to synchronize the items with their revisions, they need to be versionable.
* In case they are not versionable, <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> will synchronize the item as per the current state of that item, available at the time of synchronization. Follow [Make Item Type Versionable](aras.md#make-item-type-versionable) in the Appendix section to learn how to make item types versionable.

## Hosting Opshub Aras Service 

<code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> requires this service to communicate with Aras Innovator server. It acts as a communication layer between Aras Innovator and <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>.

### System Prerequisites

* Configure <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> Aras Service on a machine that has .NET Framework version 4.7.2 or a higher version installed.
* Please refer to the following link for information on software and hardware requirements for installing .NET Framework 4.7.2 :
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/get-started/system-requirements

### Installation Steps

{% include "../.gitbook/includes/aras-installtion-steps.md" %}

# System Configuration

Before the user continues with the integration, he/she must first configure Aras Innovator System. Refer to [System Configuration](../integrate/system-configuration.md) to learn step-by-step process to configure a system. See the screenshot given below for reference:

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/Aras_System_config_6.png" alt="" width="1100"></div>

| **Version**                        | Provide version for Aras Innovator Instance. Check [Get Aras Innovator Version](aras.md#get-aras-innovator-version) in the Appendix section to learn how to get Aras Innovator version.                                      |
| **Aras Innovator Instance URL**    | Provide URL for Aras Innovator Instance. Example: `<hostname>/InnovatorServer/Server/InnovatorServer.aspx`                                                                                                                   |
| **Aras Innovator User Name**       | Provide username of the user dedicated for <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>. Please ensure that user has the necessary permissions. Refer to [User privileges](aras.md#user-privileges) for permissions required by user identity. |
| **Aras Innovator User Password**   | Provide password of user dedicated for <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> - use plain text if FIPS is disabled, or MD5-hashed if FIPS is enabled. |
| **Aras Innovator Database name**   | Provide Aras Innovator Database name to which the connection needs to be done. Refer to [Get Database Name](aras.md#get-database-name) in the Appendix section to learn how to get Database name.                            |

* If the system is deployed on HTTPS and a self-signed certificate is used, then the user should import the SSL Certificate to be able to access the system from <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>. Check [Import SSL Certificates](../getting-started/ssl-certificate-configuration.md) to learn how to import SSL certificate.

# Mapping Configuration

Map the fields between Aras Innovator and the other system to be integrated to ensure that the data between both the systems synchronize correctly.
Check [Mapping Configuration](../integrate/mapping-configuration.md) to learn the step-by-step process to configure mapping between the systems.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/Aras_System_mapping_5.png" alt="" width="1250"></div>

# Integration Configuration

Set polling time as the time after which the user wants to synchronize data between Aras Innovator and the other system to be integrated. Also, define parameters and conditions, for integration, if any. Check [Integration Configuration](../integrate/integration-configruation.md) to learn the step-by-step process to configure integration between two systems.

<div align="center"><img src="../assets/Aras_System_Integration_4.png" alt="" width="1250"></div>

## Criteria Configuration 

* If the user wants to specify conditions for synchronizing an entity between Aras Innovator and the other system to be integrated, he/she can use the **Criteria Configuration** feature.
* To configure criteria in Aras Innovator, integration needs to be created with Aras Innovator as the source system. The user can set a query on a particular ItemType.
* Go to Criteria Configuration section on [Integration Configuration](../integrate/integration-configuration.md) page to learn in detail about Criteria Configuration.
* Aras Innovator Query format is **`[ItemType].<field_internal_name>='<value>'`**

**Criteria samples**

| **Field Type**          | **Criteria Description**                                                  | **Criteria snippet**                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lookup**              | Synchronize all ECR with priority set to 1                                | [ECR].priority = '1'                                                   |
| **Date**                | Synchronize all entities created after certain date                       | [ECR].created_on > '2020-01-31T00:00:00'                              |
| **Text**                | Synchronize all ECR with Title Demo entity                                | [ECR].title = 'Demo entity'                                            |
| **Text** and **Lookup** | Synchronize all ECR with unit EA and Status new                           | [ECR].unit = 'EA' AND [ECR].status = 'New'                            |
| **Lookup** or **Date**  | Synchronize all ECR with priority set to 1 or Effective Date greater than | [ECR].priority = '1' or [ECR].effective_date > '2020-01-31T00:00:00' |

## Target LookUp Configuration 

* Provide Query in Target Search Query field so that it is possible to search the entity in Aras Innovator when it is the target system.
* Go to **Search in Target Before Sync** section on[Integration Configuration](../integrate/integration-configuration.md) page to learn in detail about how to configure Target LookUp.
* Target LookUp configuration is similar to the [Criteria Configuration](aras.md#criteria-configuration) where in the Target Search Query field, the user can provide a placeholder for the source system’s field value in-between ‘@’.
* Target Look Up Query based on internal id of source itemtype:
  **Example query:** `[ECR].custom_text='@oh_internal_id@'`

# Known Behaviors

**Remote ID Synchronization**

* In Aras, custom entity types don't have Item Number (which stores Display Id) field by default. Hence, in such cases, <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> will use entity's Internal Id as Remote Id to be synchronized to the other end system.
* To show the 'Display Id' as Remote Id, it is required to add the Item Number field in Aras.
  Refer to [Add Item Number Field](aras.md#set-item-number-for-custom-entity) for more details.

# Known Limitations

* Only English alphabets(A-Z,a-z), numeric digits(0-9) and special characters (Example:- :,<,?,>,],\[,!,@ etc.) are supported for Criteria Configuration.
* Attachment as a field is not supported.
* "No Related" Relationship Type is not supported.
* For Aras Innovator as Target System, if the attachment filename contains Windows special characters (/,,",:,\*,?,<,>), then file will not be added in Aras Innovator. As a result, the user will encounter a processing failure. This is because Aras Innovator does not support Windows special characters in filename.
  Please check [Synchronise file with Windows special characters](../help-center/troubleshooting/errors/aras/oh-aras-1502.md) to find how to synchronise attachment with Windows special characters in filename.

## Limitations to be Resolved in Upcoming Releases of <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>

* To synchronise File as Attachment to Itemtype being synchronised, there should be unique relationship type between Itemtype and File.
* Comments with attachments are not supported.
* Synchronisation of Inline image in a Formatted text field is only **supported** for **External Files of Image type**.
  Inline image synchronisation in Formatted text fields is **not supported** for **Aras Innovator's Internal Images**.
