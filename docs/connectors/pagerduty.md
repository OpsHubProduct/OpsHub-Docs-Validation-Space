# Prerequisites

## User Privileges

1. Create a user in PagerDuty that is dedicated for <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>. This user shouldn't perform any other action from PagerDuty's user interface. We will refer to this user as IntegrationUser further in the document. For the steps to add user, please see [Steps to Add User](#steps-to-add-a-user).

2. For authenticating the above user, we would need an API token. For the steps to generate an API token, please see [How to Generate API token](#how-to-generate-api-token) section.

### Roles and Permissions

* **When PagerDuty is only source end point (Only Read)**  
  * Assign **Observer** role to IntegrationUser.  
  * If you want to configure [Remote Entity Fields](../integrate/integration-configuration.md#tracking-id-and-link-of-entities-across-systems), please refer to **Read & Write** section below.

* **When PagerDuty is destination end point (Read & Write)**  
  * Assign **Responder** role to IntegrationUser.


In PagerDuty, permissions can be assigned in either of the three ways:

1. **Permission at Instance level**: If you want to assign permissions for the incidents of all the public services, please refer to [Permission at instance level](#instance-level-permission) section for step-by-step guide on how to assign these permissions.

2. **Permission at Service level**: If you want to assign permissions for incidents in a particular service, please refer to [Permission at service level](#service-level-permission) section for step-by-step guide on how to assign these permissions.

3. **Permission at Team Level**: If you want to group services into teams and assign permissions to the team instead of assigning the same permission at multiple services, please refer to [Permission at team level](#team-level-permission) section for step-by-step guide on how to assign these permissions. Refer to [How to group services into teams](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/teams) for help around grouping the services into teams.

# Mapping Configuration

Map the fields between PagerDuty and the other system to be integrated to ensure that the data between both the systems synchronize correctly.

Click [Mapping Configuration](../integrate/mapping-configuration.md) to learn the step-by-step process to configure mapping between the systems.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/PagerDuty2.PNG" width="1000" />
</p>

> **Note** : **While configuring mapping, the details appearing in the 'Projects' drop-down are services in PagerDuty.**

> **Note** : **Refer to the table given below to see which fields are supported when PagerDuty is Source and Target.**

| **Field Name**       | **DataType** | **Is supported when PagerDuty is Source?** | **Is supported when PagerDuty is Target?** |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Incident Key         | Text         | ✅                                         | ❌                                         |

## Comments

There are two types of comments in PagerDuty:
* Notes
* Status Updates

Synchronization for both of these comment types is supported.

By default, **Notes** in PagerDuty is synchronized to and from the other end system.

User should change the comments mapping manually to synchronize **Status Updates** in PagerDuty to and from the other end system.

To learn how to configure comment mapping, refer: [Map Comments](../integrate/mapping-configuration.md#comments)

# Integration Configuration

In this step, set a time to synchronize data between PagerDuty and the other system to be integrated. Also, define parameters and conditions, if any, for integration.

Click [Integration Configuration](../integrate/integration-configuration.md) to learn the step-by-step process to configure integration between two systems.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/PagerDuty3.PNG" width="2000"/>
</p>

> **Note** : **While configuring integration, the details appearing in the 'Projects' drop-down are services in PagerDuty.**

## Criteria Configuration

If you want to specify conditions for synchronizing an entity between PagerDuty and the other system to be integrated, you can use the **Criteria Configuration** feature.

To learn how to configure criteria, refer: [Configure Criteria](../integrate/integration-configuration.md#criteria-configuration) page.

In PagerDuty, criteria can be configured on the fields: **Status** and **Incident Key**.

| **Field Name** | **Criteria Description**                                  | **Criteria Example**                             |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Status         | Status is *acknowledged*                                   | statuses[]=acknowledged                          |
| Status         | Status is *acknowledged* or *triggered*                   | statuses[]=acknowledged&statuses[]=triggered     |
| Incidence Key  | Incidence key is *abc* (here, abc is just example, you can get incidence key of an incident after creating it)       | incident_key=abc                                 |

## Target LookUp Configuration

Provide query in Target Search Query field such that it is possible to search the entity in the PagerDuty as a destination system.

To learn how to configure Target Lookup, refer: [Configure Target Lookup](../integrate/integration-configuration.md#search-in-target-before-sync)

In PagerDuty, Target Lookup can be configured on 3 fields: **Incident Number**, **Incident Id**, and **Incident Key**.

| **Field Name**     | **Target Lookup Query Syntax**              |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Incident Key       | incident_key=@Source_System_Field_name@    |
| Incident ID        | ID=@Source_System_Field_name@              |
| Incident Number    | ID=@Source_System_Field_name@              |

# Known Limitations

**When PagerDuty is Source**
* For below fields, revision details are not available. Hence, only the state of these fields at the time of synchronization will get synchronized, and the states before the time of synchronization will not be synchronized.
  * **Status**, **Conference Number**, and **Conference URL**
* **Criteria** is not fully supported in PagerDuty. An entity is considered as qualified only if it meets the criteria and is **created** after the polling time.

**When PagerDuty is Target**
* **Description** cannot be updated. So, to avoid failure, keep the 'Sync When?' to 'Create' while mapping from other end point to PagerDuty in **Advanced Settings**. To learn about Advanced Settings, refer: [Advanced Settings](../integrate/mapping-configuration.md#advance-settings)
* **Status** cannot be changed from ‘Acknowledged’ to ‘Triggered’ through integration. If it is tried to be changed, then failure would be generated.
* **Conference** fields unset is not possible. If user tries to unset it, then no failure occurs, but it will not be unset as well.

## Best Practices

**When PagerDuty is Source**
* Having single integration for two services will give more performance than having two integrations for each service. If you configure two different integrations for two services, then one will not slow down the performance of other, but if you know the services upfront, configuring it in one go will give high performance. But, what if a user later wants to add a service to an integration?  
  **Ans**: The user should create separate integration first, integrate past data and then merge both the services in one integration.

# Appendix

## Add User

To perform synchronization with PagerDuty, add a user for integration to the PagerDuty System. This user should not perform any task from UI.  
Login to the PagerDuty system with base role **Admin**, **Global Admin**, or **Account Owner** to add a new user.

## Steps to Add a User

1. Go to **Configuration** → **Users**

<p align="center">
