## Versionable Item Type

- For any Item Type in ReadyOne, the versions/history for the item gets generated only when the item is versionable. Hence for <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> to synchronize the items with their revisions, they need to be versionable.
- In case they are not versionable, <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> will synchronize the item as per the current state of that item, available at the time of synchronization.
Follow [Make Item Type Versionable](#make-item-type-versionable) in the Appendix section to learn how to make item types versionable.

## Hosting Opshub ReadyOne Service

- <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> requires this service to communicate with ReadyOne server. It acts as a communication layer between ReadyOne and <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>.

### System Prerequisites

- Configure <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> Aras Service on a machine that has .NET Framework version 4.7.2 or a higher version installed.
- Please refer to the following link for information on software and hardware requirements for installing .NET Framework 4.7.2:  
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/get-started/system-requirements

### Installation Steps

| **Version**                    | Provide version for ReadyOne Instance. Check [Get ReadyOne Version](#get-readyone-version) in the Appendix section to learn how to get ReadyOne version              |
| **ReadyOne Instance URL**     | Provide URL for ReadyOne Instance. Example:- <hostname>/InnovatorServer/Server/InnovatorServer.aspx                                                                  |
| **ReadyOne User Name**        | Provide username of the user dedicated for <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>. Please ensure that user has the necessary permissions. Refer to [User privileges](#user-privileges)          |
| **ReadyOne User Password**    | Provide password of user dedicated for <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>.                                                                                                                    |

| **Base URL for Remote Link**  | Provide different Instance URL of the ReadyOne Instance. This URL is used for generating the Remote Link. <br>If empty, the Server URL will be used.                |

- If the system is deployed on HTTPS and a self-signed certificate is used, then the user should import the SSL Certificate to be able to access the system from <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>. Check [Import SSL Certificates](../getting-started/ssl-certificate-configuration.md) to learn how to import SSL certificate.


# Mapping Configuration

Map the fields between ReadyOne and the other system to be integrated to ensure that the data between both the systems synchronize correctly.  
Check [Mapping Configuration](../integrate/mapping-configuration.md) to learn the step-by-step process to configure mapping between the systems.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/ReadyOne_System_mapping_5.png" width="1250px" />
</p>


# Integration Configuration

Set polling time as the time after which the user wants to synchronize data between ReadyOne and the other system to be integrated. Also, define parameters and conditions, for integration, if any. Check [Integration Configuration](Integration Configuration) to learn the step-by-step process.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/ReadyOne_System_Integration_4.png" width="1250px" />
</p>

## Criteria Configuration

- If the user wants to specify conditions for synchronizing an entity between ReadyOne and the other system to be integrated, refer to this **Criteria Configuration** feature section.  
- To configure criteria in ReadyOne, integration needs to be created with ReadyOne as the source system. The user can set a query on a particular ItemType.
- Go to Criteria Configuration section on [Integration Configuration](../integrate/integration-configuration.md) page to learn more.
- ReadyOne Query format is:

```json
[{"condition":"EQUALS","field":"field_name","value":"field_value"}]
```

* To learn how to form a query in above format in detail, please refer to this [OpsHub-Query-format](../integrate/opshub-query-format.md).

### Criteria Samples

| **Field Type**              | **Criteria Description**                                               | **Criteria snippet**                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lookup**                 | Synchronize all entities having priority set to 'High'                 | `[{"condition":"EQUALS","field":"priority","value":"High"}]`                                                                                               |
| **Date**                   | Synchronize all entities created after certain date                    | `[{"condition":"GREATER_THAN","field":"created_on","value":"2020-01-31T00:00:00"}]`                                                                        |
| **Text**                   | Synchronize all entities with Title Demo entity                        | `[{"condition":"EQUALS","field":"title","value":"Demo entity"}]`                                                                                           |
| **Text** and **Lookup**    | Synchronize all entities with title Demo entity and status set to New  | `{"condition": "and","criterias":[{"field": "title","condition": "EQUALS","value": "Demo entity"},{"field": "status","condition": "EQUALS","value": "New"}]}` |
| **Lookup** or **Date**     | Synchronize all entities with priority set to High or Effective Date greater than | `{"condition": "or","criterias":[{"field": "priority","condition": "EQUALS","value": "High"},{"field": "effective_date","condition": "GREATER_THAN","value": "2020-01-31T00:00:00"}]}` |


# Target LookUp Configuration

* Provide Query in **Target Search Query** field so that it is possible to search the entity in ReadyOne when it is the target system.  
* Go to **Search in Target Before Sync** section on [[Integration Configuration]] page to learn in detail about how to configure Target LookUp.  
* Target LookUp configuration is similar to the [[Criteria Configuration](#criteria-configuration) where in the Target Search Query field, the user can provide a placeholder for the source system’s field value in-between `@`.

**Example** — Target Look Up Query based on internal id of source itemtype:  
```json
[{"condition":"EQUALS","field":"custom_testing_text","value":"@oh_internal_id@"}]
```

# Known Behaviors

**Remote ID Synchronization**  
* In ReadyOne, custom entity types don't have an *Item Number* (which stores Display Id) field by default.  
  → In such cases, `<code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>` will use the entity's **Internal Id** as **Remote Id**.  
  → To show the Display Id as Remote Id, add the **Item Number** field in ReadyOne. Refer to [Add Item Number Field](#set-item-number-for-custom-entity) for more details.  
* In ReadyOne, the *project concept* is only supported for the `Requirement` Item Type (`req_Requirement`).

# Known Limitations

* Only English alphabets (A–Z, a–z), numeric digits (0–9), and special characters (e.g., `:`, `<`, `?`, `>`, `]`, `[`, `!`, `@`) are supported in Criteria Configuration.
* **Attachment** as a field is not supported.
* `"No Related"` Relationship Type is not supported.
* If the attachment filename contains **Windows special characters** (`/`, `\`, `"`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `<`, `>`), then the file will not be added in ReadyOne (processing failure occurs).  
  → This is a ReadyOne limitation.  
  → See [[OH-Aras-1502|Synchronise file with Windows special characters]] for how to handle such attachments.


## Limitations to be Resolved in Upcoming Releases of `<code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>`

* To synchronize **File as Attachment** to an ItemType, there must be a **unique relationship type** between ItemType and File.
* **Comments with attachments** are not supported.
* Synchronization of **Inline image** in a **Formatted text field** is:
  - ✅ **Supported** for **External Files of Image type**
  - ❌ **Not supported** for **ReadyOne's Internal Images**
