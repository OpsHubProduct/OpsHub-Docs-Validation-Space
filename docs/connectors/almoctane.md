# Prerequisites

## Required custom field
User must create one special field to be configured in all target ALM Octane workspace(s) for each workitem type. This field is required to ensure system recovery in case of failure or abrupt exit from the integration.

| Field Name         | Field Type |
|--------------------|------------|
| oh_last_update_udf | String     |

For adding a custom field in any entity in ALM Octane, please follow the link: [Custom Fields Creation](#create-custom-fields).

## User Privileges
* Create one ALM Octane user for workspace(s) that is a part of synchronization. User should be dedicated to <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> and should not be used to do any other operations from the system's user interface.
* Given below are the set of required permissions/roles for synchronizing entities in ALM Octane. Integration user used for system configurations should be assigned, at least, with the following roles for successful and correct synchronization of data:
  * **Leader role**: For reading/writing standard work items such as Defect, Story, Quality Story, Requirement Folders, Requirement Documents, Feature, Epic, Test Manual, Gherkin Test, Test Suite, Run Manual, etc.
  * **Workspace Admin role**: For reading/writing Meta entities that includes Release, Sprint, Team, Milestone

# System Configuration

* A system can be configured using either Basic or API Key authentication for both on-prem and SaaS (on-demand) environments.
  * Click [System Configuration](../integrate/system-configuration.md) to learn the step-by-step process to configure a system. Refer the screenshot given below for reference.

* If the system is deployed on HTTPS and a self-signed certificate is used, then you will have to import the SSL Certificate to be able to access the system from <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>. Click [Import SSL Certificates](../getting-started/ssl-certificate-configuration.md) to learn how to import SSL certificate.

# Mapping Configuration

Map the fields between ALM Octane and the other system to be integrated to ensure that the data between both the systems synchronizes correctly.  
Click [Mapping Configuration](../integrate/mapping-configuration.md) to learn the step-by-step process to configure mapping between the systems.

# Integration Configuration

Set a time to synchronize data between ALM Octane and the other system to be integrated. Also, define parameters and conditions, if any, for integration.  
Click [Integration Configuration](../integrate/integration-configuration.md) to learn the step-by-step process to configure integration between two systems.

# Criteria Configuration

Criteria-based polling is supported on all system and custom fields for ALM Octane.  
Provide queries in a format that is acceptable by ALM Octane API.  

For example:
* `release EQ {name EQ ^release1^}`
* `Severity EQ 'High'`

Query 1 will synchronize entities that have value `release1` under Release field and query 2 will synchronize entities that have value `High` for Severity field.  
For more details on query-able fields and values, refer the REST API documentation of ALM Octane from the link given below.  
https://admhelp.microfocus.com/octane/en/16.1.100-16.1.200/Online/Content/API/query_Clause.htm  

>  This URL is for ALM Octane version 16.2.100.33.

# Known Behaviors and Limitations

* ALM Octane does not support creation of requirement documents and requirement folders at the same hierarchy level. Therefore, every requirement document will be created in ALM Octane in a default requirement folder named REQUIREMENTS_CONTAINER maintaining the parent hierarchy above.
* ALM Octane supports a hierarchy depth of only 3 levels. Application module is checked, created, and separated based on `\` separator. If an entity with a hierarchy greater than 3 levels is coming from the source system, due to the imposed limitation of ALM Octane, the entity will be created at the 3rd hierarchy level.
* No testrun-link-to-defect support at Run Manual steps level (Run Manual entity level support exists for the mentioned items).
* When Octane is the target system, the link between **Run Manual** and **Run Suite** will not be synced.  
  * **Reason:** The required API is not available.
* The **Script** field of a Gherkin Test entity will be synced as **plain text only**.  
  > **Note** : Formatting in the **Script** field will not be synced due to API limitations.
* To synchronize the **Add Call Step**, a customized workflow is required. Please reach out to the opshub support team for assistance in setting this up.
  * If you are using **OpenText ALM Quality Center** as the source system and **OpenText ALM Octane** as the target system—where **Call to Step** functionality is needed—you can use the pre-bundled default workflow: **Default Integration Workflow – HP Test to Octane Manual Test – Call to Step**.
* Shared Epics cannot be created.  
  **Reason:** API unavailability.

## Steps to activating Basic Authentication in ALM Octane
The value of the **SUPPORTS_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION** parameter must be set to **true** to enable Basic Authentication.  
There are two ways to change this parameter: **site level** and **space level**.

*Using **site level***:
* Log in as a site administrator
* Navigate **Settings > Site > Parameters**
* Now select **Scope**:
  * To activate basic authentication for all available spaces, select **Site**
  * To activate basic authentication for a specific space, select the corresponding **space** name
* After selecting **Scope**, try to find a parameter with ID **SUPPORTS_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION**
* Edit the value field and set the value to **true** and click **Save**

*Using **space level***:
* Log in as a space administrator
* Navigate **Settings > Spaces > Parameters**
* Try to find a parameter with ID **SUPPORTS_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION**
* Edit the value field and set the value to **true** and click **Save**

## Create Client ID and Client Secret
* Navigate to the ALM Octane homepage. A dropdown menu will appear on clicking settings icon.
* Select spaces in settings and navigate to the left panel.
* Navigate to your ALM Octane Shared Workspace and navigate to the API ACCESS tab.
* Credentials for Access key can also be used if they are already known.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/ALMO_API_Access_2.png" width="900px">
</p>

* If no such access key has been generated, a new API ACCESS key can be generated with the below steps:
  * On selecting **add new API access**, the following form will pop up on your screen.
  * Enter the details for name and the roles to be assigned to the API access key. Refer to [User Privileges](#user-privileges) to learn more about the types of roles to assign.
  * Store the Client Id and secret for using it during system configuration.  
  > **Note** : Expiration date can be set. In such cases, API access key will have to be generated again after the date of expiration.
