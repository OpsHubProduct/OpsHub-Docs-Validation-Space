# Overview

* <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> supports OAuth-based authentication for IBM Engineering Requirements Management DOORS Next system. <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> requires the OAuth token and OAuth token secret.

  * [Option 1](#generate-token-using-doorsng-token-generator-utility): Use a stand-alone utility bundled with <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> to generate the OAuth token.  
  * [Option 2](#generate-token-using-rest-client-postman): Generate an OAuth token using a third-party rest client such as postman.

## Generate Token Using DoorsNG Token Generator Utility

* This stand-alone utility automates the OAuth token generation and eases the system configuration in <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> for IBM DOORS Next system, supporting OAuth-based authentication.
* This utility helps to generate OAuth token and allows the user to push back the generated token back to <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> given the push back to <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> server option is selected.
  * If push back to <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> option is selected and the given IBM DOORS Next system name does not exist in <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>, then the utility will create the new system in <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> with a given name along with generated token details.  
   * If push back to <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> option selected and the given IBM DOORS Next system name does exist in <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>, then the utility will update the authentication parameter(s) such as consumer key, consumer secret, OAuth token, and OAuth secret against found system in <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>.
*  This utility can be executed from any machine that has access to the IBM DOORS Next endpoint and <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>.
   * It is required to install python version >=3.7.0 to run this utility.
*  Extract the **DoorsNG_Oauth_Token_Generator.zip** located at `<Installation Directory of <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>>/Other_Resources/Resources`. 
   * Execute the command **py token_generator.py** from the command line. 
   * If IBM DOORS Next endpoint is configured with secured connection (HTTPS), then import the SSL certificate to the location `<Extracted Path>/DoorsNG_Oauth_Token_Generator/certificate/doorsnext`.*  
   * If <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> is configured with secured connection (HTTPS) and push back OAuth token option is selected, then import the SSL certificate to the location `<Extracted Path>/DoorsNG_Oauth_Token_Generator/certificate/opshub`.
   *  Refer README.txt file present inside the extracted zip folder to learn more details about this utility.

## Generate Token Using Rest Client (Postman)

* OAuth token generation is 3 steps once consumer key and consumer secret generated in end system.

### Get the OAuth Request Token

* Get the OAuth Request Token using the generated **Customer Key** and **Customer Secret** as per the step [Generate Consumer Key](ibm_rational_doors_next_generation#steps_for_oauth_token_generation).
  * Open PostMan or Rest client for sending the request for OAuth Token.  
  * Set the Get Method, set the URL as `<DOORS Next URL>/jts/oauth-request-token`, set the Authentication Type as OAuth 1.0.  
  * Set **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** in the request.  
  * Click *Send*. In the response, OAuth token and OAuth token secret will be generated.

### Authorize OAuth Request Token: Authorize OAuth Token generated in above step.
 * To authorize OAuth Request Token, prepare the request mentioned below and open in the browser. It requires the login with a user who has admin privileges.
    * Authorize URL:: `<Server+url>/jts/oauth-authorize?oauth_token=<oauth_token which was generated in previous request>&oauth_consumer_key=<consumer key which was generated in first step>`
    * For example: `https://10.13.28.146:9443/jts/oauth-authorize?oauth_token=795c926555f0433488e1211ccc8fa953&oauth_consumer_key=0efec206ae034e309c8470ca9779c128`

### Get final access token

* After authorizing the OAuth Token, send a request to get the final access token.

  * Open PostMan or Rest client for sending the request for OAuth Token.  
  * Set the Get Method, set the URL as `<DOORS Next URL>/jts/oauth-access-token`, set the Authentication Type as **OAuth 1.0**. Set the required field for OAuth 1.0 like Customer Key, Customer Key Secret, and provide the OAuth token and OAuth token secret that was generated in step 3.  
  * Click **Send** to get final OAuth access token, OAuth token secret for OAuth Authentication.
