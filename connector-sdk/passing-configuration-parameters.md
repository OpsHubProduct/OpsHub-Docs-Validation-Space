- {{SITENAME}} assumes that Connector SDK API implementation will be stateless. SDK is not required to have a database to persist any data (though, if SDK implementation wants to use a database to store something, they can do it).  
- {{SITENAME}} will capture all the required parameters at the time of system configuration. OpsHub will pass all these parameters to the connector SDK APIs in **Request Header** for **each API call**.
